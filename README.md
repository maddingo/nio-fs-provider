FileSystemProviders for java.nio introduced in Java 7. 
From version 3.0.0, only Java 17 is supported.

It allows File system operation agnostic to the underlying implementation,
much like Apache VFS, but now in standard Java.

__NB:__ The project has moved in Maven Central.
This library was previously published with groupId `no.uis.nio` in Maven Central. Version 1.1.7 is the last version under this groupId.

Newer versions are published with groupId `no.maddin.niofs`.
